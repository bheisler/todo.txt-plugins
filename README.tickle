README file for tickler scripts

This is based off Braden Grams tickle work at http://github.com/bgrams.

tickle has been tidied up somewhat. Now todo.txt exports all variables so the script is simplified only.
tickled shows a chronological list of all future tasks. So you can move/remove future tasks if required.

There is only one manual task to be done, adding TICKLER_DIR variable in your config file .cfg.
